    "During this datalab we are going to use the Single-level Breit-Wigner (SLBW) resonance formula to reconstruct the cross sections. This formula can be derived by applying the Schr√∂dringer equation to a compound nucleus model with a single excitation level, however this is outside of the scope of this course. The SLBW formula should only be applied to isolated resonances, and is sometimes favoured because it can be implemented analytically in reactor physics calculations (similarly as we will do now). However, generally many levels of the compound nucleus interact, therefore for more accurate reconstructions Multi-level formulae should be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "One can notice also, that infact the interpretation of the ENDF tape mentioned \"Reich-Moore parameters\", thus you probably guessed that the parameters allow for applying something called the Reich-Moore (pronounced as \"Rich-Moore\") representation, which is a multi-level formulation. The interested reader is referred to Chapter 3.4 \"Resonance Representations\" in the [NJOY16 manual](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016-manual/master/njoy16.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our endeavour, the SLBW formalism is satisfactory, since the first 50 resonances of U-238 can still be assumed to be isolated, and because our main goal is to understand the principle of reconstructing resonance. Therefore we will have no use for the last two GFA and GFB columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SLBW formula for the radiative capture cross section is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_\\gamma(E)=\\sigma_0\\frac{\\Gamma_\\gamma}{\\Gamma}\\Big(\\frac{E_0}{E}\\Big)^{1/2}\\frac{1}{1+y^2}$$\n",
