    "While discussing slowing down through elastic scattering our main assumption is typically that scattering is isotropic in the Center-of-Mass (CM) frame. Some textbooks, such as [Nuclear Reactor Analysis from Duderstadt and Hamilton](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/89079/1976_Nuclear_Reactor_Analysis.pdf) (see page 318) will go one step further and mention (often between lines) that the average scattering cosine in CM can be given as \n",

    "Based on this one expression however it is difficult to imagine how the distribution of $\\mu_c$ looks like in case of anisotropy. It is still worth visualizing in which regions this average cosine is less then some threshold (0.1 in this example) to illustrate the energy and nuclide mass range when isotropy is a fairly acceptable assumption. Note however, that assigning a threshold for isotropic behaviour is somewhat arbitrary."

As the energy increases, the scattering typically becomes more and more forward peaked, and higher and higher Legendre orders will be needed. If the energy goes through a resonance, dramatic swings from forward scattering to backward scattering may be seen. At the highest energies, the scattering is basically the diffraction of a wave around a hard sphere, and the results are similar to diffraction patterns for light. The forward peak is like the bright central spot in a diffraction pattern, and the oscillations at larger angles are analogous to the fringes seen for light."

Among possibly many exceptions, the books of Z. Szatmáry ([Introduction to reactor physics](https://oktatok.reak.bme.hu/kdp/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2019/09/Bevrf.pdf) - pp153-155 - and [Reactor physics calculations](https://oktatok.reak.bme.hu/kdp/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2019/09/rfszam-2.pdf) - pp5-20 -) are known to the author, which place a great emphasis on discussing anisotropy in elastic scattering, therefore helping the reader to gain a physical insight in the topic. Unfortunately, these books are written in Hungarian, nevertheless, the mathematics and the graphs can be still appreciated by foreign readers. This notebook was greatly motivated by the books of Z. Szatmáry, and several of the figures created here are based on the figures in the referenced books.
