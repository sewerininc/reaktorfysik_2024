    "Previously we studied how energy-dependent cross sections can be reconstructed from the resonance parameters. These resonance parameters are a property of the nucleus, hence they do not depend on temperature. Therefore it can be considered that our reconstuction was related to 0 K temperature. In this datalab, we will study how temperature affects the cross sections, and we will perform an approximation to broaden the resonance of U-238 at 6.67 eV. The student is expected to read the chapter \"Effects of nuclear motion\" from [Nuclear Reactor Analysis from Duderstadt and Hamilton](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/89079/1976_Nuclear_Reactor_Analysis.pdf) (page 45-52) along this section. The datalab provides only a brief review of the theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ENDF files the resonance parameters belong to the case when the target nuclei are at rest, however in practice this is not the case due to thermal motion with a thermal energy of $E\\cong kT$. At temperatures typical for nuclear reactors this energy is only comparable to the neutron's kinetic energy if the neutron has also thermal energies. Execute the code cell below to inspect thermal energies at typical reactor temperatures."
