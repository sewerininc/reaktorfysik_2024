Today we go one step further and will explore the real power of the python API. Namely that we can automatize calculations simply by defining a function which creates the input for us. Then we can write loops and automatically update our model. For this we will use the `Model()` class of openMC. This basically means that instead of exporting all the details of the run into xml, openMC will take care of this, when we call the `.run()` method of the class.\n",
