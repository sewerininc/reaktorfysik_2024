    "During the previous datalab we have learnt about the basic built-in features of python: we learnt about variable and data types, loops and conditions. We also mentioned before that there are thousands of open source packages which can be imported to python. Several of these libraries are considered rather standard (and preinstalled when using anaconda). If we would like to create a package executing less standard tasks (for example parsing nuclear data formats), it is worth browsing the world wide web for pre-existing solutions before reinvintenting the wheel. There is for example the nuclear engineering toolkit called Pyne which provides a lot of functionality relevant for nuclear scientists. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next two datalabs we are going to try some standard libraries, and get acquainted with various data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries reviewed today are:\n",
    "- numpy which provides data containers and functions to perform numerical analysis, matrix operations, linear algebra and a lot more.\n",
    "- matplotlib which provides visualization tools from simple 2D plots to advanced 3D visualizations\n",
    "- scipy which provides scientific tools, for example fitting, ODE solvers, numerical integration\n",
    "- re which allows using regular expressions. A regular expression (often called regex or regexp) is a search pattern specified as a sequence of characters. The `re` package provides regexp operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is neither possible nor necessary to review all the features of these packages, rather we would like to provide you with the basic terminology and to cover the basic functionality of these packages. That said, what is imporant for now is to know about these packages, familiarize yourself with the basic principles of these tools. Later, in other exercises we are going to refer to functions and methods of these libraries. It is not required to keep all functionality of these libraries in your head, as you will advance you will often find yourself googling for solutions, reading through stackoverflow entries, and then with your basic understanding and the knowledge of the terminology you will be able to adapt the proposed solutions to your own needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other mainstream libraries of python which we will not cover at all in this course. For example symPy allows for symbolic operations, or sklearn provides an interface to machine learning models. Nevertheless, once you got a feeling for using python, it will be relatively easy for you to use any other package according to your future needs.\n",

    "\n",
    "We saw before how to organize data in arrays called lists. Lists are extremely flexible, they can store data of different types (eg. `[1,'one',True]`), and one can easily create multidimensional lists, or matrices (eg. `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`). Nevertheless, in some sense this flexibility is also a drawback. If we perform operations on a list (for example by looping over its elements, and performing some simple mathetmatics), Python needs to check the type of each element. For a compiled code, when the type is declared beforehand such checks are not needed, hence it runs faster. Numpy (numerical python) offers a more efficient data structure called *numpy array* (which stores elements of the same type) and provides related data operations. Numpy arrays are important building blocks of several other tools (eg. data science applications), and they make life easier, hence it is valuable to understand how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the numpy array, numpy contains a lot of useful functions and libraries (operations and linear algebra on the arrays, random number generators etc), which we will not cover now, but we will use them later on. \n",

The pattern `[+-]?\\d+\\.\\d+` encodes a floating point number: in `[+-]?` the ? indicates zero or one occurence of the preceding element, which in this case is one of the characters in the `[]`. Outside of the bracket, the + indicates one or more  occurance of the preceding element, and `\\d` indicates a digit, so `\\d+` will match one or more digits. In total `\\d+\\.\\d+` will look for one or more digits followed by a floating point and followed by one or more digits. This pattern will not match numbers written as '1.' or '.9932'."

    "The minimum energy required to disassemble the nucleus of an atom into its components is the binding energy. In this exercise you are going to compute the binding energy per nucleon for several nuclides in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. based on the relative atomic mass of the nuclides\n",
    "2. based on a semi-empirical formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we substract the mass of the nucleus from the mass of the nucleons and express it in energy unit we get the binding energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$B(A,Z)=[Z\\cdot m_p+(A-Z)\\cdot m_n-M(A,Z)]c^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given nuclide one can estimate the binding energy with the semi-empirical Bethe–Weizsäcker formula, which has various forms in literature. Here you can use the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$B(A,Z)=15.75A-94.8\\frac{(A/2 - Z)^2}{A}-17.8A^{2/3}-0.71Z^2A^{-1/3}+34\\delta A^{-3/4}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta = 1$ for even-even nuclei, $\\delta = -1$ for odd-odd nuclei and $\\delta = 0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: that all terms in the formula have a physical meaning: volume term, assymmetry term, surface term, Coulomb term and pairing term. Make sure based on the text book that you understand these).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first formula one can express the neutron and proton mass in unified mass units (u). Also notice, that in most tabulated data (also here) you can only look up the relative atom mass of isotopes, and not the mass of the nucleus, thus the mass of the electrons needs to be taken into account as well. The reason for this is that for high Z isotopes it is difficult to remove all the electrons, so the neutral atoms are measured instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the relative mass (in unified mass units) of several nuclides  (downloaded from https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Compositions/stand_alone.pl?ele=&ascii=html) as a python nested dictionary `nuclides`. Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. It is basically an unorder array with \"named\" columns. In this case the outer keys are nuclide identifiers, and the values are also dictionaries, with the keys being Z, A and m.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to \n",
    "\n",
    "1. implement two functions which calculate $\\varepsilon=B(A,Z)/A$ with the two methods listed above.\n",
    "2. apply the functions for the nuclides listed in `nuclides`\n",
    "3. Plot the binding energy curves. Use solid line for the semi-empirical formula, and red dot markers `ro` for the results taking into account the relative mass\n",
    "4. Find the nuclide with the highest binding energy per nucleon, and use `plt.annotate` to include the name of the nuclide in the figure above the corresponding marker."
